## Ludum Dare 28 entry
Developer: Matthew Chan

Framework: Laravel PHP - [Laravel](http://laravel.com/).

Description: Working on a web-based game for the [Ludum Dare 28](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) competition with the theme "You Only Get One"

Ideas: I'm thinking of making some sort of dice game, where you start with only 1 dice, but you gradually work your way up.  I think there are already some dice game out there that do this, maybe variations of [Yahtzee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee).  But it'll be interesting for me to implement as a web app in anycase.
